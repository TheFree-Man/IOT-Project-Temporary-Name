Repository for our Project for Internet of Things

This project involves using the Arduino Yung and some sensors to gather data and checks if the kettle is boiled or not.
This was done by reading the analogue input and if the value goes under a certain threshold then the arduino prints out
"The kettle is boiled" otherwise it prints "The kettle is not boiled".
